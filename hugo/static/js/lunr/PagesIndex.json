licensing together As of March 9th 2015 Adobe has released Connect 94 and with it a whole new licensing model So while our old post about licensing has been a great staple for us and the Connect Community it seems that it is time to put a new version out rather than just updating the old post As we have stated in the past licensing for Adobe Connect is probably near the top if not at the top of the list of complicated things to deal with in Connect It often is either not properly explained or not properly understood and customers can get left with deployments that either dont meet or grossly exceed their needs as a result This post is intended to be a reference for what the different licensing models do how they work limitations advantages etc but will not discuss pricing If you are interested in pricing feel free to contact us directly salesrealeyesconnectcom or through our contact page here Adobe Connect is still available in three different deployment options 1OnPremise Enterprise This deployment is typically hosted on your servers and behind your firewall Since it is a server platform product it is subject to perpetual licensing This means that the server software itself and all licensing must be purchased initially but thereafter year 2 year 3 etc only the Maintenance Support is required to be purchased annually MS is required at time of purchase and is normally 20 of the total Connect product purchase In some cases special exceptions andor agreements contracts etc have been established and agreed upon by the end users and Adobe so they may differ Please visit the Adobe Platinum Maintenance Support homepage for further details Please also note that OnPremise deployments can also be a Managed Service offering meaning that the deployment is an OnPremise installation that is managed by another company 2Hosted SaaS The hosted deployment option is also known and referred to as a Software as a Service SaaS model In this case your Adobe Connect deployment is hosted on Adobes reserved server clusters That being said you are behind Adobes firewalls In some cases having your account Hosted may or may not be the best solution It is always best to first check with your IT Dept Systems Admin etc to see what may or may not be a requirement Since there may be several compliance regulations that your institution may need to adhere to or if you may need full integration with other preexisting server based products Adobes servers may be able to suffice but those kinds of questions cannot be answered here and now as the scenarios tend to vary greatly Hosted account purchases through resellers typically include baseline standard Adobe Connect Help and Support 3Adobe Connect Managed Services Enterprise SaaS This deployment is hosted on dedicated servers and managed by Adobe Systems It includes all of the benefits of an Enterprise deployment adhering to your firewall settings LDAP andor AD integration etc but since it requires no internal network administration it feels like a SaaS deployment It is a perpetual licensing model where all licensing must be purchased initially and must be renewed annually In some cases special exceptions andor agreements contracts etc have been established and agreed upon by the end users and Adobe so they may differ Please contact us directly if you have questions about the Adobe Connect Managed Services option A PDF overview on Adobe Connect Managed Services can be viewed andor downloaded here While the deployment options have stayed the same Adobe has reworked the licensing models for Connect So here is where you will see the changes Ill start with the modules that havent seen a change New licensing will have the titles in italics Meeting Module Concurrent User With this licensing the total number of licenses you purchase will be the total number of users that can be online in a live meeting at any given time either hosting or attending a meeting These licenses are not assigned or applied to named individuals they are firstcomefirstserve So if you have 100 Concurrent User licenses then you can have a single meeting with 100 people 100 meetings with 1 person each or anywhere in between so long as the total number of attendees for meetings is less than or equal to your Concurrent User licenses This model works as a licensing pool the same as the Concurrent Learner licenses described below Named Host With this licensing a Named Host can host a Connect Meeting at any given time of up to 100 attendees The licensing model itself refers to a named specific user cannot be a general login that is in the Meeting Hosts Group For instance if you purchase 15 Named Host licenses you have the ability to place up to 15 people in the Meeting Hosts Group Each of the people in that group can have up to 100 attendees internal users andor external users etc in any Meeting Room that theyve created Each Meeting Host Group member can run any one of their rooms at a given time and they must be present in the room for it to have full functionality This licensing model is best used for frequent usage in Meeting Rooms or also very adequate for webinars that will not exceed 100 attendees Meeting Hosts also get Author rights described below which gives them the ability to publish Content to Adobe Connect so it may be displayed in their Meeting rooms This is currently the most popular licensing model Note Named Host and Concurrent User cannot coexist on any Connect deployment as they are both representative of the Meeting Module Content Module Content Publish Also known as Author licenses These licenses are indicative of Content Module within Connect This will give anyone placed in the Authors System Group the ability to publish Content to Adobe Connect for ondemand access For instance if you purchase 15 Content Publish licenses you have the ability to place up to 15 people in the Authors System Group Note Content Publish licenses are purchasable for OnPremise Connect deployments as the Content Module is open to an unlimited number of users Since you are in control of the amount of disk space available to Connect you can decide how many individuals you want to be able to push content to the server Training Module Concurrent Learner With this licensing Connect is enabled to deploy Curriculums andor Courses on the system Any enrolled users will have their results tracked via the lightweight LMS functionality that Connect offers The concurrency portion translates to having the ability to have up to the total amount of licenses purchased online at any given time having their results tracked For instance if you purchase 100 Concurrent Learner licenses you have the ability to have up to but no more than 100 enrollees online concurrently having their results tracked Unlimited Curriculums andor Courses can be created and you can enroll an unlimited amount of users but you are capped at how many concurrent licenses you have So if you have 1000 enrollees and only 100 licenses only 100 enrollees can be tracked at any given time and the remaining enrollees will have the ability to engage in the training content and have their results tracked once the one of the enrollees have completed the training and are no longer accessing the training content Changes with Connect 94 The Concurrent Learner module will be for the creation and delivery of ondemand training The use of the Virtual Classroom and delivery of Courses within the Virtual Classroom is no longer associated with the Concurrent User license Named Virtual Classroom Manager NVCM With this licensing a Named Virtual Classroom Manager can create and run a Virtual Classroom at any given time with up to 200 attendees The NVCM can also create Courses within the Training Module of Connect but they will only be able to be delivered within a Virtual Classroom as synchronous training This is a simplification from how the Virtual Classrooms used to work which was through a combination of your Meeting licensing and Concurrent User licensing This licensing also comes with access to the Events tool Meaning that members of the NVCM group can create and manage Events to allow users to selfregister for their sessions in the Virtual Classrooms or other objects that they have access to in Connect Central Note Concurrent Learner and Named Virtual Classroom Manager licenses can coexist on any Connect deployment If you have both then the ability to deliver both synchronous and nonsynchronous training will be available Webinar Rooms Named Webinar Manager NWM In an effort to simplifiy the old Seminar Room licensing and more closely align with offerings from other competitive products a new licensing option has been created The Named Webinar Manager is similar to a Named Host for the Meeting module NWM licenses are assigned to members of the new Webinar XXX Managers group where the XXX will be the number of attendees that that manager can have in their session NWM licenses will come in 100 500 and 1000 seat capacities and also include the Events module The NWM can create as many instances of their webinar room as they wantneed but can only run one at a time NWM must be present in the Webinar room for it to run Shared Webinar Rooms These Webinar rooms work the same as the old Seminar rooms but are only available in capacities of 500 1000 and 1500 seats Anyone may be assigned as a Seminar Administrator group formerly known as the Seminar Host group and can run a session in those Webinar rooms Sessions must be scheduled as they have been in Connect 9 to get access to the full licensing limit Unscheduled sessions can have full access to the licensing limit if no prescheduled sessions will cause a conflict Note Named Webinar Manager and Shared Webinar Room licenses can coexist on any Connect deployment Events Module Updated Named Event Manager With this license an account can be given the ability to create and manage Events within Connect An Event is a portal that is created to allow external users to view upcoming Events and selfregister for those events This can take the workload of creating new users off the account administrators and provide a customizable and embeddable catalog of live and ondemand events being offered from within your Connect accountThe trick to effectively creating and managing events is having access to the objects in Connect that need Events So if you are creating Events for Meetings be sure you have access to where those Meetings reside in the Meeting Library If you are creating Events for Content be sure you have access to where the Content resides in the Content Library If you are creating Events for Trainings be sure you have access to where the Courses or Curriculum are in the Training Library Note If Events are going to be linked with Training objects be sure to have your user registration setting to create Registered User accounts instead of guest accounts Guest user accounts wont properly track interactions and passfail status with Training objects If you are a current Adobe Connect customer you will be given a grace period to change any existing licensing over to the new licensing offerings If you dont have any licenses that are changing then you dont need to worry about anything Adobe Connect will remain the same for you If you are a new customer or an existing customer looking to add new functionality to your Connect deployment you will only be able to purchase under the new licensing moving forward And there you have it the new licensing for Adobe Connect as of March 9th 2015 If you have any questions or comments feel free to post them below You can also contact us directly and well do all we can to help you move forward with your Adobe

The modrewrite tool utilizes Regular Expressions RegEx and anyone whos worked with them knows that they can be very cumbersome to create and test for validity That being said Ive recently found several useful tools to help ease my suffering while working through to create regexs for modrewrite RegEx 101 The first tool is RegEx 101 Its a very fancy tool that not only allows you to write your regex online but also allows you to test the regex on various strings to make sure that the regex will work correctly The other added bonus is that it has some useful help information Screenshot imgblogcontentregex101png Also regex 101 has some cool sharing features too For instance heres a permalink to a regex that I was playing around with recently for HLS streaming One note Apache uses PHP PCRE style regex syntax so make sure thats selected for Your Regular Expression In otherwise you might end up creating a useless regex Htaccess Tester Sometimes coming up with the right regex is not enough especially if youre unfamiliar with how modrewrite rules are written In those cases you can leverage the htaccess tester application To use it fill in the URL that people will be hitting then

Device Emulation","Emulation","Chrome’s Dev Tools","DevTools"],"categories":["How To"],"href":"mobile-device-testing","content":" Mobile device testing is necessary but presents many challenges When you consider that over the past 5 years mobile devices have risen from 09 to over 15 of all internet traffic and that number will continue to climb source slide 32 its become increasingly important to make sure that there is at least a basic level of support for mobile users in anything you build While there are new tools and technologies popping up daily to help make that easier there are still an incredible number of challenges involved One of the most common is finding devices to test your creations with Even for those of us that tend to collect far more gadgets than the average bear there are almost certainly a very great number of devices that will not be available to us There is a recent phenomena of Open Device Labs that can definitely offer some help with that for instance the Rocky Mountain Open Device Lab here in Denver but there isnt always going to be one that is convenient or even available When devices simply arent available its still important to try to test the best that you can with some fallback options There are many available options for emulating various mobile devices on a desktop ranging from some small browser extensions that simply resize your window to match the pixel dimensions of a few devices to subscription services that offer many more features to fullblown device simulators available in Xcode or the Android SDK Any of these options are far better than nothing but there always seems to be a compromise Most free and lightweight options tend to be lacking in features the subscription services can be quite pricey and the 96GB footprint of Xcode on my machine at least can seem a bit ridiculous especially if you dont actually tend to build native iOS or Mac apps Chromes Dev Tools now offer a solution imgblogcontentrobotpng Luckily as of version 32 Google Chrome has added a rather impressive and builtin set of capabilities for Mobile Device Emulation to DevTools By and large this new offering addresses all of the compromises I listed above There is a rather comprehensive level of functionality as compared to any device emulator the tools are free and built right into Chrome and while Chrome can eat up a lot of resources especially if you tend to open and use as many tabs as I do it is still much much lighter than Xcode and is probably one of your primary browsers anyway Enabling device emulation So with that bit of Chrome DevTools fanboyism finished heres a quick introduction on how to enable and use the new mobile device emulation features They are a bit hidden so heres how to turn them on and get to them Open DevTools MenuViewDeveloperDeveloper Tools OR CMDCTRLALTI Open DevTools Settings Click on the Gear icon near the righthand side of the DevTools menu bar Click on the Overrides tab If youre using Chrome Canary stay on the General tab and look under the heading Appearance Tick the checkbox for Show Emulation view in console drawer Close the settings imgblogcontentdevToolssettingspng imgblogcontentEnableEmulationTab1png That will enable the device emulation features or at least enable the menu for them now to get to them all you have to do is open up the console drawer hit ESC in any Dev Tools tab other than the Console Tab and youll see a new tab available titled Emulation imgblogcontentemulationTabpng Emulating a device When you first open that tab Device in the list on the leftside should be selected by default and will allow you to select from a fairly impressive list of devices Ill be using the Google Nexus 4 in this example Selecting a device will display a few key data points specific to that device which Chrome will then emulate Viewport Pixel Dimensions 7681280 Pixel Ratio 2 Font Scale Factor 1083 User Agent Mozilla50 Linux Android 421 enus Nexus 4 BuildJOP40D AppleWebKit53519 KHTML like Gecko Chrome1801025166 Mobile Safari53519 imgblogcontentavailableDevicepng At that point all you have to do is click the Emulate button and Chrome will resize its view and reload the current page as though it were the device you selected By default emulating a device will turn on a standard set of options though you can easily add or remove the available capabilities as well as tweak and finetune the settings for almost all of them Manipulating your emulated device Drilling down through the remainder of the list on the leftside of the Emulation tab will allow you to see and customize all the available details that Chrome is using to emulate your selected device The Screen section seems the most immediately useful but the Sensors section seems the coolest There is one other very important thing to call out as a use for all these customization options Since we have the ability to finetune so many different device properties it means that it is entirely possible to emulate almost any device you can find the specs for Granted DevTools provides presets for just about all of the popular devices out there but its good to know that youre not limited to their list Working with screen properties The Screen section allows several options for finetuning the way Chrome emulates the selected devices display By default the Resolution values will be set to match the chosen devices realworld pixel resolution In general when emulating tablets Chrome will set the initial Resolution values as though the tablet is in Landscape horizontal orientation When emulating phones they will initially be shown in Portrait vertical orientation You can easily swap the two values by clicking the button between the two resolution text fields imgblogcontentScreenOptionspng One thing to be aware of is that swapping these values will make the device viewport appear as though it has rotated though in terms of device behavior it has really just resized What this means for your debugging is that any styling that uses breakpoints based on width should behave just fine If on the other hand you happen to have JavaScript listening for an orientationchange event in iOS it wont fire because there isnt any accelerometer activity being emulated when you swap those values This is a prime example of why as impressive as these tools are its still important to test on actual devices whenever possible It is also important to note that if you enable the Shrink to fit option in this panel it can override the resolution values that are set The aspect ratio will be maintained but if your browser window is smaller than the defined dimensions the emulated display will be resized to fit within it While this is definitely useful in some instances youll want to remember to disable this option before you measure anything Changing the user agent Next in our list is the User Agent section which is fairly straightforward It allows you to toggle between using Chromes default User Agent String which will provide relatively accurate information about your browser and hardware set up to sites that you visit with the thought that they may serve up different content and experiences depending on your configuration With that mind it makes sense that when attempting to emulate the Nexus 4 from our examples earlier you probably dont want to provide a User Agent String that identifies your setup as a Mac Desktop with the latest version of OSX Conveniently if youre using one of the default device presets available from the list in the device section Chrome will have already selected and enabled the the corresponding User Agent from its list If you would like to edit the string for some reason simply make your change in the textbox and hit Enter If you are emulating a custom device other than the provided presets you can replace the entire User Agent String I find that UserAgentStringcom is usually a good resource for finding strings from any number of browser versions imgblogcontentUserAgentOptionspng Emulating sensor data Last in the list is the Sensors section which offers up some settings that are possibly a bit less commonly needed in day to day web development but are extremely cool Only the first option Emulate touch screen will get enabled by default When it is active your cursor will render as a semitransparent circle that is just large enough to help you keep touchtargets in mind Paul Irish has a nice demo available on his site for experimenting with the touch events imgblogcontentSensorsOptionspng At this point in time there are some limited capabilities for emulating multitouch interactions Currently only a simple implementation of the Pinch to Zoom action is available though it seems likely to me that functionality for other common multitouch gestures may be added in future updates To use this action hold down the SHIFT key then either click and drag or scroll As with most of the options available in the emulation panel it is possible to turn on or off the touch screen option independent of any other settings On the back end of things touch events will be added in with some of your mouse events Using this option will not disable mouse events it simply adds in touch events As an example while Emulate touch screen is active when you click with your mouse the page will receive a touchstart event in addition to the mousedown event To see this illustrated you can visit this Event Listener Test and turn touch screen emulation on and off The sensors section also has Geolocation and Accelerometer properties I think these properties would be best explained by pointing you to some cool little demos that have been created I encourage you to experiment Geolocation Demo Device Orientation Demo Wrapping your head around the Accelerometer values can be a rather daunting task especially when looking at text only values which is whats currently available in the mainstream version of Chrome 3201700107 If you are interested in working more with the accelerometer I would highly recommend downloading Chrome Canary as that version of the Device Emulation panel includes a small 3D representation of your device which rotates to illustrate the accelerometer values The good news is that since thats currently available in Canary it will probably show up in regular Chrome sometime relatively soon imgblogcontentSensorsOptionsChromeCanarypng Getting your normal browser back Once youve finished testing or playing with a device and are ready to exit device emulation and get Chrome back to normal just go back to the Device section and click the Reset button Everything will return immediately to the normal desktop browser state with a whole set of Mobile Devices that are quickly and easily available to emulate whenever you need them again Keep calm and continue testing As Ive already mentioned these tools should not replace actual device testing by any means but they should augment the process nicely and provide a very convenient method for doing quick checks during development"},{"title":"Sublime Text

RegexOnecom if you arent familiar with Regular Expressions at all The actual syntax of regex can vary slightly between coding languages PHP and JavaScript for instance but for this articles purposes Sublime Text uses Perl Regular Expression Syntax from the Boost library Full documentation can be found at boostorg which you will want to reference when creating your own search expressions or

I wouldnt recommend going much higher though for both performance and logic reasons 1 As compared to Variation 2 only the list of search terms gets repeated as opposed to the entire set of search parameters so thats betterish It occurs to me that Im not 100 certain what will happen if all three search terms are found within the defined range of proximity My guess though would be that it shouldnt break anything too thoroughly you would just end up with a set of results that included each combination listed as a separate match even though they all pointed back to the same chunk of code 2 Id be willing to bet that theres a much more succinct way of accomplishing all this but these ones work and Im still very much in the early stages of learning regex That being said if you have any suggestions for improving those strings Id love to hear them IncludeExclude Filters imgblogcontentfilterScreenshotjpg These are some useful strings to use in the Where field to make your search run faster and avoid cluttering your results with say the entirety of jQuery in its minified format or all of the libraries youre pulling in with npmboweretc Include File Types jstplhtml Say youre looking for a style attribute thats getting added dynamically and throwing off your selectors because it gets added as an inline style instead of toggling a class based off of that you know that its almost certainly in either a fullblown JS file or a script tag somewhere Combine that with the knowledge that even though our hypothetical values are used pretty commonly throughout the CSS there are probably only a handful of instances that it occurs in the JS So you could exclude all the CSS files css from your search and hopefully trim down the number of search results keeping them more focused and more likely to be relevant as well as reducing the number of files being searched by a little bit However excluding CSS explicitly will still search every single file of any other filetype Exclude Minified Files mincssminjs OR min Exclude Component Libraries bowercomponentsnpmmodules Conclusion Although we really just scratched the surface of what Sublime Text and Regular Expressions can do I hope this quick overview of some of Sublime Texts more advanced searching capabilities has given you some ideas of how to search more efficiently based on your own preferences or the needs of a specific project Tangents and non sequiturs 1 Im sure it affects overall search performance and in general adding more possibilities to match against will result in more matches being returned which is good I suppose if youve run a more limited search already and the code youre hoping for is not showing up but if you get back a huge list of questionable relevance then that defeats the entire purpose of searching in the first place 2 So actually I bet you could probably write a search with enough parameters and a large enough range of proximity that depending on your system specs and the size of your code base it would in fact hang or crash Sublime Text but I think youd have to be trying fairly deliberately to do that"},{"title":"Using JMeter to Load Test Live HLS Concurrency of Wowza

expressions","optimization","server","Gaussian"],"categories":["How To"],"href":"wowza-streaming","content":" Introduction When I was tasked with determine the max users that an m4xlarge AWS instance running WowzaStreamingEngine delivering HLS content could reliably handle I found out quickly I had a fairly difficult task ahead of me Luckily I found a few blog posts that pointed me in the right direction and provided the base JMeter test plan to work with Understanding HLS Protocol HLS or HTTP Live Streaming is an HTTP based media streaming protocol developed by Apple Inc It works by breaking a media resource into a sequence of smaller chunks and fragments that may be split among a variety of different encoding data rates Since HLS is an HTTP based protocol it is able to bypass any firewall or proxy server that lets through standard HTTP traffic unlike other protocols such as RTMP This allows content to be delivered by standard HTTP servers and delivered from a wide variety of CDNs and streaming engines such as Wowza Testing Platforms and Plugins When first researching the best methods to successfully test our service I came across a few options First option was to use floodio following the directions in this blog post provided by floodio This provided some good information but since the project was fairly small it did not seem worth it to have to pay the extra money for this load test Maybe in the future if we need to perform load tests more often this might be a good route for us Second option that I found was to use a HLS Plugin for JMeter developed by Ubik Ingnierie Ubik wrote a great blog post that describes how most load testing of HLS content can be very unrealistic and it would be very time consuming to create an exact realworld simulation of how a browser handles the HLS protocol After downloading their plugin and starting some initial testing I found their plugin to be very easy to setup and provided some great test results However their free plugin only allows a very limited number of concurrent users and the price for the plugin with the number of users we wanted was too much for this project If we ever run into a very large project that needed the most reliable test data this plugin would be a great choice for us The third option that I found and ultimately followed through with was to create my own test script using JMeter The results would not be as accurate as the first two options but they would be good enough for the size of the project that I was working on I started with the code base I found here and the steps mentioned by Itay Mendel in his blog post on blazemetercom then modifying a test plan to match my needs Creating the Test Plan The first step is to make a standard HTTP Request for the contents playlist manifest imgblogcontentplaylistrequestpng Once the playlist is requested I created a Gaussian Random Timer with a deviation of 3000 ms and a constant delay of 1000 ms This creates a delay between subsequent requests with a minimum delay of 0 seconds and maximum delay of 4 seconds with a Gaussian curve distribution similar to a symmetric bell curve imgblogcontentrandomtimerpng The next step is to parse the response of the playlist request for a list of chunklists using a Regular Expression Extractor imgblogcontentregexextractorpng Then using a ForeachController that will loop through each chunk provided by the chunklist and make another HTTP Request to the chunklist manifest imgblogcontentchunkrequestpng Now we perform the same process to extract the stream fragments from the chunk manifests imgblogcontentstreamsextractionpng imgblogcontentstreamlooppng imgblogcontentstreamrequestpng Overall the structure of the requests and variable extractions looks like imgblogcontentstructurepng Finally once the test structure is complete and all bugs are worked out the last step is to configure the ThreadGroup for concurrency and duration of the test For our load testing we wanted to start with 300 users with a 60 second ramp up that streamed video for 5 minutes each Than after each test bump the number of users up by 300 To do this I setup the thread group options as such imgblogcontentthreadgrouppng One interesting point is that for this test in order to control the duration each user streamed the video for a scheduler was created with a random date in the past This would start the test instantly and make the duration option available for use Cost and Server Optimization Since we are testing on an Amazon EC2 AWS Instance we wanted to limit costs during the load testing To avoid having to pay for large bandwidth amounts since we ultimately wanted to test against more than 1000 users streaming content we launched a second m4large instance and installed Jmeter on it This new instance became the server with which we ran the tests from which allowed us to capitalize on AWS pricing for private IP address data transfer costs which is exactly 0 While optimizing I found a post by Philippe Mouawad here which explains the best practices and tuning tips for using JMeter with high concurrency Here are the tips that I integrated into my testing environment Remove all listeners and instead generate results after the test is complete Log all results to csv format Run JMeter in cli instead of gui binjmeter t n l resultscsv Some other tunings we performed on both the JMeter instance and the Wowza instance were Increased the number of files allowed to be opened on the server nofile Increased the maximum file handles that can be allocated fsfilemax Increased the max amount of file handles that can be opened fsnropen Increased how many connections the NAT can keep track of in the tracking table before it starts to drop packets and just break connections netipv4netfilteripconntrackmax We did this by adding the following to etcsecuritylimitsdcustomconf root soft nofile 1000000 root hard nofile 1000000 soft nofile 1000000 hard nofile 1000000 etcsysctlconf fsfilemax 1000000 fsnropen 1000000nbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbsp netipv4netfilteripconntrackmax 1048576 netnfconntrackmax 1048576 Server Monitoring To monitor the EC2 instance and verify that its CPU usage Memory usage Network IO and the Load Average are within tolerable limits we used NewRelics monitoring platform imgblogcontentnewrelicpng NewRelic performs agentbased monitoring which allowed us to watch the servers stats during the test This helps us ensure with confidence not only the users are able to view the stream properly with the JMeter test but the server is handling the loads properly and there will be no server side problems during production Summary Were grateful to know that there are so many resources available on the Internet to help work through new challenges With a little creativity and the ability to piece together information from multiple sources theres so much that can be accomplished For instance even if youre testing VOD HLS on Adobe Media Server or some other streaming solution you should be able to take some pieces from our article and the resources we leveraged to jumpstart your own load testing initiative We enjoyed working through our challenge and hopefully this article helps you work through your challenge in the way that the articles we found helped us"}]
