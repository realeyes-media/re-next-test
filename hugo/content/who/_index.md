heroContent1: Our team of consultants and technologists are passionate about creating highly engaging streaming media experiences. We are equally at ease powering the world’s most anticipated and watched streaming events and programming—including the Olympics, World Cup, The Super Bowl, and the Masters—or enabling companies like Oracle to seamlessly and securely broadcast to a global network of over 50,000 employees. From bespoke application development to complex media aggregation and intelligence, RealEyes’ versatile team of technologists are adept at complementing existing technology teams to tackle some of the industry’s most complex problems.
heroContent2: Considered industry shapers and thought leaders, we deliver exceptional viewer experiences for broadcasters, media and e-gaming companies, as well as for brands whose needs cannot be met by off-the-shelf software. We do this through a mix of consulting, bespoke development, and our own robust platform and suite of products, enabling us to deliver tailored solutions that help ensure success every single time.
heroContent3: At RealEyes we don’t believe you should be limited by inflexible technology. You can rely on us to provide insight and to push the boundaries of off the shelf streaming platforms. Whatever suite of products you use, our own or someone else’s, we will be joined at the hip with you to deliver perfection.
