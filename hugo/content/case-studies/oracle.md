**Blog Post:**

Oracle wanted to securely connect their worldwide team to the training, strategic market material, and leadership communications delivered in the format that reaches people best—streaming video. They turned to RealEyes to develop and implement a solution to efficiently deliver videos worldwide without saturating Oracle’s network bandwidth, eCDN.

**Challenge Accepted**

In addition to creating an enterprise world-wide video delivery solution, RealEyes had the extra challenge of having to configure a system without direct access to Oracle’s infrastructure. Always up for a challenge the RealEyes team coordinated with Oracle to simulate their environment onto the RealEyes system and moved ahead on building out a solution. RealEyes leveraged Varnish, caching software to create multiple points of presence at strategic locations within the Oracle network - eCDN - to eliminate the bandwidth needs and allow global viewership of videos. The team also brought in Chef configuration management software to easily install, configure, and reconfigure these varnish servers throughout the network with standard and centrally managed configuration.

**Location, Location, Location…**

With servers built in strategic locations throughout Oracle’s network - eCDN - people around the globe were able to view Oracle’s videos and, because they were getting them from servers closer to their location, the reduction in network traffic significantly improved the overall viewing experience.
