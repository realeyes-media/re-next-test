**Viacom & RealEyes: Customized Solution Content Storage**
Viacom wanted to move from an HLS dynamic packager to a static packager system. This way  they could have their own HLS content and store all the assets themselves on any origin for any CDN packagers. They knew that this was what they wanted, they turned to RealEyes for our expertise in media workflows and HLS content, and because they knew we could get it done with technology they could easily manage in the future.

**No Existing Solutions? No Problem.**
RealEyes went to work researching open source encoding and packaging applications. When no good solution could be found, a custom solution was created that could work on its own and mix and match with open-source third party solutions. A big challenge was manifest and conditioning and fragment splicing for frame accurate ad insertion, specifically being able to create Q-points in iframes. With the custom solution those points can be created without recoding the iframes offering a huge performance benefit.

The assets RealEyes created allow Viacom to have previously tested and stored static assets, creating a more reliable and consistent bandwidth quality.
