AMEX came to RealEyes with technical problems they were encountering with the launch of a critical homepage application. Helping them to resolve this issue, they then requested assistance with advanced development as their current partners were not able to offer solutions. RealEyes provided rich Internet applications which spanned across their homepage, card center, and other business units. These were the most viewed applications on their site.

**Customized Approach**

Gaining the trust of AMEX through the work done on the original application launch, RealEyes went on to provide analysis on their development and architecture, including custom on-site training. We also developed critical solutions for customization-driven user experiences to meet critical business needs. This work spanned over three years and multiple key products.

**Enhanced User Experience**

Being able to launch the original homepage quickly and confidently helped RealEyes gain the trust of AMEX to develop a new homepage, which outperformed the previous one with greater capabilities and overall longevity. This was followed by the delivery of a highly enhanced and improved user experience and performance for other critical applications.
