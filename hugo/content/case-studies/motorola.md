Adobe was working with Motorola on extremely advanced body camera footage management system for law enforcement that would allow the public to request and view video while maintaining the privacy of the people being filmed. While Adobe had enterprise Java developers with expertise around regular application functionality and development, they were not media experts. Adobe turned to RealEyes to partner with them in video feature development that would work within their asset management solution. 

**Custom Solution to Help Solve a Nationwide Problem**

Based on the Motorolaâ€™s requirements for MVP (minimum viable product), RealEyes leveraged the best technologies and frameworks to build a solution to need specification within the Adobe AEM assets platform. Working with video generated by Motorola body cameras, RealEyes built a solution using our own custom HTML video player with advanced functionality and integration. This included integrating with a dynamic redaction service to allow the public to make Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests for law enforcement body camera footage. Despite working with a video generated by a product in the developmental stage, RealEyes as able to offer creative approaches to re-encoding the content to mask faces out while maintaining frame accuracy and providing visual feedback and editing capabilities to users of the system without advanced video editing experience. 

**Building Public Trust While Maintaining Privacy**

With the help of RealEyes, Motorola was able to bring a product to market in a time where law enforcement desperately needs to build trust with the public through communication and transparency.
