The past year was a pivotal year for streaming video. Powered by its Playmaker Media operations, NBC Sports led the sports industry by delivering 4.37 billion live streaming minutes for the three biggest digital events of 2018: Super Bowl LII, the PyeongChang Winter Olympics, and Spanish-language coverage of the 2018 FIFA World Cup. Including its other sports, NBC Sports delivered 90,000 hours of streaming coverage across more than 30,000 events for 6.5 billion minutes for the year (up from 3.4 billion in 2017) breaking streaming records for the NFL, NHL, NASCAR, MLB, NBA, Golf, Horse Racing, Premier League, Notre Dame Football, and Olympics.

The stakes couldn’t be higher for supporting streaming video events of this scale, and NBC Sports relies on a network of trusted partners to ensure exceptional services for its customers. With an experienced team and extensive video streaming capabilities, RealEyes began working with NBC Sports in 2012 shortly after the London Olympics. As an industry leader in streaming video, RealEyes’ deep expertise includes advanced video player development, large scale streaming delivery systems, and an ability to troubleshoot complex systems and global live events quicker than anyone else. These competencies have enabled RealEyes to serve many prominent customers, including NBC Sports, over the past 15 years.
 
“To execute not just one but three major events of this size, scale, quality, and stability in such a short duration is unheard of in the digital video delivery landscape,” said Eric Black, SVP and CTO, NBC Sports Digital and Playmaker Media. “With partners like RealEyes, we look forward to future opportunities to innovate and deliver world class solutions for both NBC Sports Group and our Playmaker Media partners.”

RealEyes also supplied and deployed its MOE:QC/Packager for quality control (QC) and multi-CDN ad content packaging for NBC Sports in 2018. These services helped NBC Sports to deliver the highest quality of seamless ad delivery, adapt to industry changes, and maintain solid performance and resiliency while automating complex manual tasks.

For more than six years, the RealEyes team has been a trusted development and strategic consulting partner across all streaming platforms of NBC Sports. RealEyes and NBC Sports propelled 2018 to one of the most exciting and successful years in streaming video, and we look forward to collaborating towards more cutting-edge advances in 2019. RealEyes has been honored to work with NBC Sports and be part of the many successes realized in 2018.
