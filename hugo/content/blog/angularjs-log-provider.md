Logging and debugging is a daily occurrence when developing JavaScript based applications. AngularJS provides a simple, effective way to enable logging in your applications â€“ the $logProvider. $logProvider is used to enable logging and the $log object is used to log within your applications objects.

## Enabling

Enabling the $logProvider is as simple as injecting the $log object into your object and then calling $log.debug(); to send logs to the console.

Example:
<iframe src="http://jsfiddle.net/jccrosby/7qpzB/embedded/js,html,result" height="300" width="100%" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

## Turning off logging


You can disable logging (AngularJS 1.1.2+) by calling
$logProvider.debugEnabled(false);

Example:
<iframe src="http://jsfiddle.net/jccrosby/N2B6R/embedded/js,html,result" height="300" width="100%" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

## Extending

AngularJS provides a mechanisms to extend the built in $logProvider, $provider.decorator(). An example will get the point across much more quickly than me trying to explain it all.

Example:
<iframe src="http://jsfiddle.net/jccrosby/d7P5C/embedded/js,html,result" height="300" width="100%" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

Basically we intercept the call using decorate so we can add on the features and functionality we need to the $log.debug() call.
